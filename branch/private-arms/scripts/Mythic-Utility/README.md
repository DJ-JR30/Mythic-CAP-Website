#### AES
Under AES when you get the return the code will
lool lile this:

```
['U2FsdGVkX1/6rYsjA84Kvh/wwXlLV4dlv0cI5BNThQY=', '858ed7met6r5bVRf']
```

the First String is the Encrypted Text, the Second on
is the key. It shows both to the return
because the Key Generator can't save Key for
you to look over later so its send out in `[Text,Key]`
